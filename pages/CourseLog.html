                    A useful tip I learnt in class was to use the tab function to clean up code (e.g. inline code). You can also select all then click tab. I'm most interested in learning scrollytelling interactions and AR.

                    Learning how to import styles I've designed on Figma to VS code via developper mode was neat!

                    One important takeaway from the lecture was the importance of having a color script that can be shared with others on the team to maintain a consistent vision, mood, and overall aesthetic of the project. Another lecture takeaway is the power of arrows in storyboards to direct camera and object movement. From the media lab, I found the feedback process extremely useful. I was able to see how differently a fellow classmate created their storyboards. Bonnie effectively used arrows to show camera movement, even having arrows and scenes extend outside of the frame. I also liked how she manipulated the camera boxes to show the dimensionality.

            <!--WEEK 4-->
            <div class="intro">
                <div id="subtitle">Lecture 4</div>
                <h1>Web Dev 104</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="mainContentColumn">

                <p>
                    Two important takeways from this class: I learnt that it's important to have structured, consistent storyboards. I liked how Bonnie had the narration script below the panel and extended drawings outside of the panels. An important takeway from this media lab was that you need to consider how user interactivity and control will affect the progression of the story, and in turn, will affect how you create your storyboards.

            <!--WEEK 5-->
            <div class="intro">
                <div id="subtitle">Lecture 5</div>
                <h1>Web Dev 105</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="mainContentColumn">
                <br>
                <p>
                    An important takeaway from this class: It's important to think about accessibility and your audience when designing scrollytelling sites. Some sites we saw for the media lab had really small font or used too many animated elements that could be difficult for viewers with motionsickness. Scrollytelling is used for linear narratives.
