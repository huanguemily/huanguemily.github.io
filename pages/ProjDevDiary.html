                An overview of the work done this week for Beanie’s Backyard! <br> There’s always so much to do but in terms of managing my time, I find it’s nice to start working on interactive media things during the weekend when I can sit down and fully focus on the task at hand. 
                <br><br><b>Tuesday</b><br><br> We presented our pitch on Tuesday Feb 4 to the class. Afterwards, we planned to meet on Thursday to discuss more about our plan, scope and visual concept. Although we each have our defined roles in the project (e.g., I’m the creative director), we had already decided to split the work evenly. This meant each person was in charge of two animals. I was in charge of the rat and opossum. So on Saturday, I started to work on my assigned animals. (Note: We cancelled Thursday’s meeting because all our tasks were clearly written out on our Notion project management page. If we had any issues, we would contact each other on Discord).
                <br><br><b>Saturday</b><br><br> We each needed to do research about the animals, gather references and create our own sketches. These were preliminary sketches that could be stylized or realistic. It was necessary to get something out so we could see what we were going to be working with. In terms of the research, we created a Google Docs with tabs for each member. In each document, animal research was done for: their habitat, diet, when do we see them, how to keep them safe, fun facts and sounds they make. While we won’t use all of the information we researched, it was better to have more to work with than to find out we needed more information later on when we start production. <br>
                While I was doing research, a few more ideas popped in my head as to how the scrollytelling page could work. I went into our brainstorming Figma and recorded my thoughts. In a dark blue-black environment scene, the user would scroll down and a flashlight glow or firefly would move across the screen. As the user keeps scrolling, it will eventually stop at a bush, porch or tree. The object would start to rustle or glow, prompting the user to click on it. Once clicked, the animal hiding behind it will appear and the scrapbook will come out from the bottom/side and animal facts would be recorded in it. The user can read through the facts, close the book and continue scrolling down. Beanie would not be included in any of the hiding spots. Only once the user reaches the end and uncovers all the animals in their backyard, does Beanie walk into frame, unharmed and back home. <br> My other idea was to incorporate a mystery element to this scrollytelling page, while still making it a linear narrative in which the user cannot freely roam the screen. I asked myself: why does Beanie run out to the backyard at night in the first place? Maybe his toy was stolen. But by who? And why (maybe leveraging the animal facts, like how ravens and crows like to steal shiny things). One of the backyard animals? This can create a stronger narrative that engages the user to continue scrolling to find out the culprit. In this case, instead of a scrapbook, it would be a notepad, just like a detective’s. At the end of the story, the culprit is revealed and Beanie gets his toy back. <br><br><b>Sunday</b><br><br>We did a lot of collaborating on the Figma on Sunday, Priya added some really neat ideas on top of my scrollytelling ideas! We also continued adding more visual inspiration in hopes of solidifying our concept and visual style early next week.
