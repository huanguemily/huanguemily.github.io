    <main>
        <p>Terminal cancer is a pressing health issue that takes a huge emotional and mental toll on the patient. However, the impact of this diagnosis on patient caregivers is often overlooked. Many caregivers are family, friends or relatives who take on this role informally and unpaid. Caregivers experience levels of distress equal to or greater than patients, yet effective, evidence-based resources for caregivers of patients with advanced cancer remain scarce. They face unique emotional and mental challenges compared to those caring for patients with potentially curable cancer, such as anticipatory grief and feelings of shame and guilt.</p>

        <p>The Managing Cancer and Living Meaningfully (CALM) team at Princess Margaret Caregiver Clinic from the Department of Supportive Care have created a written document called <i>CALM for Caregivers: A Workbook for Family Caregivers of Patients with Advanced Cancer</i>, that caregivers can engage with independently. This project will transform this textual document into an engaging, highly visual workbook, employing empathetic comics that embody the caregiver experience. Not only will this make the workbook's caregiver stories, psychoeducational materials, and reflective exercises more accessible and effective, it will allow caregivers to see their own lived experience reflected in the content.</p>
